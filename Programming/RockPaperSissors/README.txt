Create two intelligent agents for rock paper scissors.
This program takes three inputs from the user, the first being the name of the first algorithm. The other name will be 
titled "computer."

The second one is the total number of games the user would like to be played
and the third is the refresh rate of times it will show on screen.
Both are integers.

Output of analysis will show accordingly, with the final bit being the result of every match.
