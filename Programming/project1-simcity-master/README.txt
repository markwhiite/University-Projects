How to compile and run program:
Compile normally with g++ *.cpp

Upon running, program will prompt user for a file. We have included a file called "config1.txt" to use as an example in the folder.
Please make sure to remove any extra lines at the bottom of the region file.

Output should display accordingly, showing the time stamps of each iteration.
User will be prompted to enter the coordinates of a rectangle to analyze more closely.
Please enter 8 digits in a row seperated by a space, do not add any commas or paranthesis.
The eight digits represent the corners of the rectangles coordiantes, so the input would be for example:
0 0 0 5 4 0 4 5

Ouput should display accordingly for analyzed region.
